Bayesian Evaluation of (Astrophysical) Source Strength   
======================================================   
In the process of exploring the Universe for (possible) signals of cosmic sources,   
we are in general facing a significant amount of background events.   
However, despite the overall background, astrophysical sources may yield   
an additional signal rate arriving from specific locations. 
  
This brings us to the essential questions :    

* Can we identify a possible source signal by measurements ?   
* Can we determine (a limit on) the source strength ?   
* What is our degree of belief in the presence of a source ?   

In these lectures I will introduce various aspects related to the strength of   
(astrophysical) sources, and provide a statistical method to address the above questions.   
The analysis method is based on Bayesian statistics, and the underlying algorithms   
have been implemented in the NcAstrolab facility of the NCFS-Pack analysis framework.
